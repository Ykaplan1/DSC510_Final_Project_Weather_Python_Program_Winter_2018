# DSC510 Final Project Weather Python Program
# Abstract
I was tasked in creating an application that interacts with a webservice in order to obtain data.This appilcation will prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from openweathermap.org. Below are a few guidelines for this project:

Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city. The user should be able to use either. Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from: http://openweathermap.org/ Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.
  
# Preview

This is a preview of the weather python program in action. If you want to try? You can find it in this repository.

# Findings
This project follows almost the same guidelines as the Chuck Norris joke program, except it involved the knowledge to include the different measurements that are related to weather. Creating a fun and interesting way to provide weather information through this python program.

# Challenges
This whole project was a challenge for me. I had to overcome many hurdles on this project. As I mentioned in the findings section, I had to include different measurements based on three levels of temperature. I also overcomed the challenges in displaying the latitude and longitude information.

# Conclusion
This being a more well robust application that had many areas that relate to the different aspects of weather information. Even though this appilcation was developed in the python programming language and it doesn't any visuals. This appilcation is able to provide the user a informed weather forecast based on Open Weather Map's database.
